# PCA
Principal Component Analysis

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique commonly used in data analysis and machine learning. Its primary goal is to transform high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional representation while retaining as much of the original variability as possible. PCA achieves this by identifying the principal components of the data, which are the directions in which the data varies the most.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the theory behind PCA:

### 1. **Covariance Matrix:**
   - Given a dataset with \(n\) observations and \(p\) features, the first step is to compute the covariance matrix. The covariance matrix provides information about the relationships between different features.

   \[ \text{Cov}(\mathbf{X}) = \frac{1}{n-1} (\mathbf{X} - \mathbf{\overline{X}})^T (\mathbf{X} - \mathbf{\overline{X}}) \]

   Where:
   - \(\mathbf{X}\) is the data matrix.
   - \(\mathbf{\overline{X}}\) is the mean vector of the features.

### 2. **Eigenvalue Decomposition:**
   - The next step is to find the eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors of the covariance matrix. These eigenvectors represent the directions of maximum variance in the data.


### 3. **Principal Components:**
   - The eigenvectors with the highest corresponding eigenvalues are the principal components. These components form a new basis for the data.

### 4. **Projection:**
   - To reduce the dimensionality, the data is projected onto the subspace defined by the principal components. The first few principal components capture the most variability in the data.


### 5. **Variance Retention:**
   - The amount of variance retained in the reduced-dimensional space is often expressed as the cumulative sum of the retained eigenvalues divided by the total sum of eigenvalues.

  

PCA is widely used for data preprocessing, noise reduction, and visualization. It is important to note that while PCA is effective for capturing large-scale patterns in the data, the interpretability of the reduced features may be diminished.
